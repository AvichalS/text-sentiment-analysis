Text analysis is a powerful tool for understanding the underlying sentiment, tone, and complexity of written communication. However, analyzing large volumes of text can be time-consuming and tedious, especially when dealing with unstructured data. That's where the Text Analysis Script comes in - it's a Python script that simplifies the process of analyzing text data by automating several key steps.

What does the Text Analysis Script do?
The Text Analysis Script is designed to import a dataset from an Excel file, extract the main text content from the links, remove stop words, and calculate several text analysis metrics such as polarity, subjectivity, complex words, and syllables. These metrics can provide valuable insights into the underlying sentiment, tone, and complexity of the text data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.
